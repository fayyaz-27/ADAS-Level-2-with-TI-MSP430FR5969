# ðŸš— Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) Prototype with TI's MSP430FR5969

This project is a **Level 2 ADAS prototype** built using the **Texas Instruments' MSP430FR5969** microcontroller.  
It demonstrates three key ADAS features implemented at a prototype scale:  

- **Lane Control (Line Following)** - Using IR sensors to detect and follow a track (simulating lane assist).  
- **Adaptive Cruise Control** - Using an ultrasonic sensor to monitor distance from obstacles/vehicles ahead and automatically adjust speed or stop when needed.
- **Collision Detection & Prevention** - Using IR sensors to detect collisions before they happen and execute preventive measures
